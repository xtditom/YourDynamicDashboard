## üîç Feature Showcase
<details>
<summary><b>Click here to see a detailed breakdown of all features</b></summary>

### Interface & Clocks
* **Digital Clock:** Displays hours, minutes, and seconds with varying opacity for a modern aesthetic. The separators between them fade in and out. Can be switched between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
* **Analog Clock:** A beautiful, minimalist analog clock, with a dynamic glow effect.
* **Dynamic Greetings:** The extension greets you with different messages depending on the time of day, such as "Good morning" or "Are you still awake?".
* **Editable Welcome Text:** A small line of text under the greeting that you can click and edit to anything you like.

### Productivity Tools
* **Live Weather:** Shows a complete weather report including a description (e.g., "Broken clouds"), a humidity progress bar, the "feels like" temperature, and your current city. *Requires a free OpenWeatherMap API key.*
* **To-Do List:** A dedicated panel for adding tasks. You can mark tasks as complete (which strikes them through) and delete them. Your list is saved automatically.
* **Multi-Engine Search:** Features a powerful search bar with rotating placeholder suggestions. Use the "Search With/On" switcher to instantly change your search provider from standard engines like Google and Bing to platforms like YouTube and Wikipedia.

### Quick-Access Panels
* **AI Tools Panel:** A pop-up menu with direct links to the most popular AI chatbots, including Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and more.
* **Google Apps Panel:** A classic 9-dot grid that opens a panel with shortcuts to all essential Google services like Google Account, Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Photos.
* **Personalized Shortcuts:** A customizable bar at the bottom of the page. You can add, edit (name and URL), and delete your own shortcuts to your favorite websites through the settings panel.

### Customization & Data
* **Deep Theming:** Beyond a simple Dark/Light mode switch, the "Appearance" tab in Settings lets you use color pickers to change the color of every single element, from the background and text to the clock's glow.
* **Custom Backgrounds:** Easily upload any image from your computer to use as a persistent background wallpaper.
* **Element Visibility Toggles:** Don't use the To-Do List or AI Tools? You can hide their buttons from the interface for a cleaner look.
* **Backup, Restore, Reset:** In the settings, you can one-click backup all your settings (including shortcuts, theme colors, etc.) to a file. You can restore from this file later or reset everything to default.
