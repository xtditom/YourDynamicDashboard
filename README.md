<details>
<summary><b>Click here to see a detailed breakdown of all features</b></summary>

### Interface & Clocks
* **Digital Clock:** Displays hours, minutes, and seconds with varying opacity for a modern aesthetic. The separators between them fade in and out. Can be switched between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
* **Analog Clock:** A beautiful, minimalist analog clock, with a dynamic glow effect.
* **Dynamic Greetings:** The extension greets you with different messages depending on the time of day, such as "Good morning" or "Are you still awake?".
* **Editable Welcome Text:** A small line of text under the greeting that you can click and edit to anything you like.

### Productivity Tools
* **Live Weather:** Shows a complete weather report including a description (e.g., "Broken clouds"), a humidity progress bar, the "feels like" temperature, and your current city. *Requires a free OpenWeatherMap API key.*
* **To-Do List:** A dedicated panel for adding tasks. You can mark tasks as complete (which strikes them through) and delete them. Your list is saved automatically.
* **Multi-Engine Search:** Features a powerful search bar with rotating placeholder suggestions. Use the "Search With/On" switcher to instantly change your search provider from standard engines like Google and Bing to platforms like YouTube and Wikipedia.

### Quick-Access Panels
* **AI Tools Panel:** A pop-up menu with direct links to the most popular AI chatbots, including Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and more.
* **Google Apps Panel:** A classic 9-dot grid that opens a panel with shortcuts to all essential Google services like Google Account, Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Photos.
* **Personalized Shortcuts:** A customizable bar at the bottom of the page. You can add, edit (name and URL), and delete your own shortcuts to your favorite websites through the settings panel.

### Customization & Data
* **Deep Theming:** Beyond a simple Dark/Light mode switch, the "Appearance" tab in Settings lets you use color pickers to change the color of every single element, from the background and text to the clock's glow.
* **Custom Backgrounds:** Easily upload any image from your computer to use as a persistent background wallpaper.
* **Element Visibility Toggles:** Don't use the To-Do List or AI Tools? You can hide their buttons from the interface for a cleaner look.
* **Backup, Restore, Reset:** In the settings, you can one-click backup all your settings (including shortcuts, theme colors, etc.) to a file. You can restore from this file later or reset everything to default.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

There are two main ways to install YourDynamicDashboard: from an official store or manually.

**1. From the Store (Recommended)**
<p>
  <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/yourdynamicdashboard/phhofebhbmicnfhmmdgikiddaboljnec" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Get%20it%20on-Microsoft%20Edge%20Store-0078D7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-edge&logoColor=white" alt="Get it on Microsoft Edge Store" height="48"> <br>

</a>
</p>
    
* NOTE: Stores may have older versions if a new version has arrived recently‚ùóCheck our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xtditom/YourDynamicDashboard/releases) for the LATEST updates.

**2. Manual Installation**

This process has two parts: first, you get the project files, then you load them into your browser.

**Part A: Get the Project Files**

You have two options to get the files:

* **Option 1: Stable Release (for most users)** <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/xtditom/YourDynamicDashboard/releases/latest">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Get%20it%20on-GitHub-181717.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white" alt="Get it on GitHub" height="48">
    </a>
  
    1.  Under the latest release (e.g., `v1.0.0`), find the **Assets** section.
    2.  Download the `.zip` file (e.g., `YourDynamicDashboard-1-0-0-S.zip`).
    3.  **Unzip** the downloaded file into a permanent folder on your computer.

* **Option 2: Development Version (for developers)**
    This will get you the very latest, cutting-edge code.
    * Use the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/xtditom/YourDynamicDashboard.git
        ```

**Part B: Install the Extension in Your Browser**

Once you have the project folder from Part A, Unzip the zip file, then follow these steps:

1.  Open your browser's extension management page:
    * **Edge:** `edge://extensions`
    * **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions`
2.  Enable **"Developer mode"** (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).
3.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
4.  Select the `YourDynamicDashboard` project folder that you downloaded and unzipped (or cloned).

Congrats! Your new Dynamic Dashboard is now successfully added to your browser extension.

## üîú Future Plans
